Async IO in Python Course Tasks - Completed

This repository contains the completed project tasks for the Async IO
in Python course. The project involved building an asynchronous application
using async IO to perform I/O-bound operations, such as reading from a file
or fetching data from a web API, efficiently and concurrently.
Project Overview

Conclusion

This project has been a valuable learning experience for me and has allowed
me to demonstrate my ability to build efficient and scalable asynchronous
applications using async IO. I hope that this repository serves as a useful
resource for other learners of the Async IO in Python course.
